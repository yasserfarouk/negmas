    A synchronized controller that tries to get no more than one agreeement.

    This controller manages a set of negotiations from which only a single one
    -- at most -- is likely to result in an agreement. An example of a case in which
    it is useful is an agent negotiating to buy a car from multiple suppliers.
    It needs a single car at most but it wants the best one from all of those
    suppliers. To guarentee a single agreement, pass strict=True

    The general algorithm for this controller is something like this:

        - Receive offers from all partners.
        - Find the best offer among them by calling the abstract `best_offer`
          method.
        - Check if this best offer is acceptable using the abstract `is_acceptable`
          method.

            - If the best offer is acceptable, accept it and end all other negotiations.
            - If the best offer is still not acceptable, then all offers are rejected
              and with the partner who sent it receiving the result of `best_outcome`
              while the rest of the partners receive the result of `make_outcome`.

        - The default behavior of `best_outcome` is to return the outcome with
          maximum utility.
        - The default behavior of `make_outcome` is to return the best offer
          received in this round if it is valid for the respective negotiation
          and the result of `best_outcome` otherwise.

    Args:
        strict: If True the controller is **guaranteed** to get a single agreement but it will have to send
