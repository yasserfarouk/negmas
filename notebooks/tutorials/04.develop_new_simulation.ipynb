    "## Develop a new simulation (world)\n",
    "\n",
    "A simulation is an embedded domain in which agents behave. It is represented in NegMAS by a `World`. This tutorial will take you through the process of developing a simple simulation (world).\n",
    "\n",
    "A `World` in NegMAS is not just a multi-agent world simulation. It was designed from the bottom up to simply the common tasks involved in constructing negotiation driven simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation is divided into simulation steps (not to be confused with negotiation rounds). At every step, agents are allowed to act proactively by executing actions in the world, reading their state from the world, or requesting/running negotiations with other agents. \n",
    "\n",
    "The negotiation process follows the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An agent requests a negotiation involving a set of agents (it may or may not be one of them) using either `request_negotiation` or `run_negotiation` methods (the later does not return until the negotiation is complete. The `World` can disable immediately running negotiations, or requesting negotiations that does not involve oneself, etc. The caller agent can also provide a `Negotiator` to represent it in this negotiation.\n",
    "2. All partners in the negotiation are asked to accept to start the negotiation through calls to `respond_to_negotiation_request`. The can accept by returning a `Negotiator` object to represent them or reject.\n",
    "3. Negotiations start depending on the rules given by the `World`. The default rule is to start negotiations only if ALL partners accepted the request but other rules like starting negotiations that are accepted by at least two partners are possible.\n",
    "4. The `Mechanism` objects are created by the `World` and negotiators supplied by all partners (that agreed to join the negotiation) are added to it. The `World` designer can fix the type of the negotiation mechanism to be used (e.g. `SAOMechanism`) or it can leave the choice to individual agents requesting negotiations.\n",
    "5. The negotiation is run and its result is recorded either as a failed negotiation (if no agreement is reached) or as a `Contract` if an agreement is reached.\n",
    "6. It is possible for world designers to either make `Contract`s binding upon agreement by having them automatically signed or to give agents one final chance to *sign* the contracts. Only signed contracts are considered binding.\n",
    "7. The `World` can also run a simulation that is affected by signed contracts. A common case is for contracts to have some *executing time* or a similar attribute that defines when do they become due.\n",
    "8. When a `Contract` becomes due, it is executed by the `World` as part of the simulation it is controlling. In some cases, the contract cannot be executed and this is considered a `Breach`.\n",
    "9. The world processes breaches and may decide to apply penalties to agents that caused them (if that makes sense for the specific simulation being conducted).\n",
    "10. Agents are informed about the final state of due contracts (i.e. whether they are executed successfully or breached). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new world, you need to do the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new `AgentWorldInterface` for your world (that inherits from `AWI`) and provide easy to use methods that agents can use to access your world. A common functionality of the AWI is to confirm that negotiations make sense. We will see an example later in this tutorial\n",
    "2. Create a new `World` class that inherits from the base `World` and implement the required callback (your AWI from the first step will need to be registered in the world as will be shown later). \n",
    "3. Create a base `Agent` class for your world that inherits from `Agent` and provides the basic functionality shared by all agents in your world (if any)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Trips World\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a -- not so simple -- world. We have $m$ agents representing people agreeing about where to spend their vacation repeatedly. Every holiday season, an agent can request to negotiate with one or more other agents trying to arrange a trip. Each trip is described by the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Active**: Binary issue (either an active trip with lots of hiking, running ,etc or not)\n",
    "* **Duration**: Integer issue (between 1 and 7 days)\n",
    "* **Cost**: Continuous range issue (between 0.0 and 1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "All agents involved in a negotiation must agree for the trip to be conducted. An agent can request at most $n$ negotiations in a single season. Each agent has some fixed but unknown probability of not honoring its agreement and failing to show up for the trip and only when all agents involved in a trip show up does the trip actually happen with each agent receiving its utility value as defined by its unchanging utility function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement this world in NegMAS."

    "The minimum here is to define a way for agents to request negotiations form the world. The base `AgentWorldInterface` has a `request_negotiation_about` method that can be used for this purpose but it is too general and allows agents to set arbitrary issues and negotiation mechanisms.

    "    if self.agent.id not in partners:\n",
    "        partners.append(self.agent.id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A negotiation request is then created using `create_negotiation_request` of the agent connected to the AWI which is used to keep track of which requests are out there and which are accepted/rejected\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "       req_id = self.agent.create_negotiation_request(\n",

    "        )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, the AWI requests the negotiation from the world using the base `request_negotiation_about` method.\n",

    "        )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than this commonly provided method, the AWI provides two properties that can be accessed by the agent, `agents` which returns the IDs of all *other* agents in the world and `n_negs` which gives the total number of negotiations that the agent can *start* in a single step (holiday season)."

    "#### Constructing the world\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do when constructing the world in `__init__` is to call the `World` class constructor forcing some of the parameters. This is done here:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    kwargs[\"awi_type\"] = AWI\n",
    "    kwargs[\"negotiation_quota_per_step\"] = kwargs.get(\n",

    "    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of note is setting the `awi_type` to the `AWI` class we have just created. This allows agents to access members of this class through their `awi` property as we will see later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we force the `negotiation_quota_per_step` to be no more than 8 (the default is $\\inf$) and force signing of all contracts which will make contracts binding immediately once agreements are reached through negotiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then define four data-members that we keep track of:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Joining the world\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents join the world by calls to the `join` method. \n",
    "* The first thing to do is to call the base `join` method of the `World` class. That is **essential** for the system to work properly. Whenever you override a method that is not marked abstract, you **must** call the base class version using `super()`:\n",

    "#### Contract Management\n",
    "\n",
    "The `TripsWorld` is responsible of managing contracts. The base `World` class will take care of most of the process but it needs the `TripsWorld` to respond to some callbacks in order to manage contract execution, storage, and optionally renegotiations of breached contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The callbacks related to this are:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def on_contract_signed(self, contract: Contract) -> None:\n",

    "    def breach_record(self, breach: Breach) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    def contract_size(self, contract: Contract) -> float:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The names are almost self-explanatory and we will go through them one by one:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **on_contract_signed** This method is called whenever a contract is signed (becomes binding). This is the only non-abstract method in the contract related set here but we need to override it in order to keep track of the execution time of the contract using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    self._contracts[self.current_step + 1].append(contract)\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. **executable_contracts** Should return a list of contracts that are due at the current step. We simply use the `_contracts` mapping we updated in `on_contract_signed`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    return self._contracts[self.current_step]\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **order_contracts_for_execution** The world is responsible of deciding that order at which contracts (returned from `executable_contracts`) are executed, here we just shuffle them randomly and return them:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    shuffle(contracts)\n",
    "    return contracts\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. **start_contract_execution** Here we decide how to execute a contract. We first check whether each agent of the partners who signed the contract is going to show up using its breach-probability and record a breach for each such event. If there are any breaches, we stop processing because the trip did not take place:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    breaches = []\n",
    "    for aid in contract.partners:\n",
    "        if random() < self._breach_prob[aid]:\n",
    "            breaches.append(\n",
    "                Breach(\n",
    "                    contract, aid, \"breach\",\n",
    "                    victims=[_ for _ in contract.partners if _ != aid],\n",
    "                )\n",
    "            )\n",
    "    if len(breaches) > 0:\n",
    "        return set(breaches)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If there are no breaches, the trip is assumed to execute successfully and every agent (of the partners) is assigned the utility value from that trip according to its utility function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    for aid in contract.partners:\n",
    "        self._total_utility[aid] = self._ufuns[aid](contract.agreement)\n",
    "    return set()\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. **complete_contract_execution** This method is only called in worlds that allow re-negotiation of breaches. As our world does not have the concept, we just do nothing here.\n",
    "6. **delete_executed_contracts** This method is responsible of cleaning up all contracts that have been processed in the current step. We again use the mapping we constructed in `__init__` and updated in `on_contract_signed`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if self._current_step in self._contracts.keys():\n",
    "        del self._contracts[self.current_step]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These six steps complete all processing of contracts. Nevertheless, we still need to override three other methods to define how contracts and breaches are stored and the *value* of a contract\n",
    "\n",
    "* **contract_record** should return a dictionary representing a contract. We simply convert it to a dictionary using a helper function from negmas `to_flat_dict`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    return to_flat_dict(contract)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* **breach_record** Same as contract record but for breaches. We do the same.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    return to_flat_dict(breach)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* **contract_size** Used to specify some sense of size for contracts. This is only used for statistics and does not affect the operation of the simulation. We define the contract size here as the welfar (total utility of all partners):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    if contract.agreement is None:\n",
    "        return 0.0\n",
    "    return sum(self._ufuns[aid](contract.agreement) for aid in contract.partners)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This complete the world and agent-world-interface design. We can now develop our base agent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statisitcs\n",
    "\n",
    "The base `World` keeps track of negotiation related statistics (e.g. how many negotiations were requested very step, how many contracted were breached, etc). You can easily add to this set of statistics by overloading `post_step_stats` (and the corresponding `pre_step_stats` if needed). In our world, we just add one custom statistic: the total utility collected by the agent so far:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    for aid, agent in self.agents.items():\n",
    "        self._stats[f\"total_utility_{agent.name}\"].append(self._total_utility[aid])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we used the agent name not ID to differentiate these statistics. Because the system does not know or use our statistic, we can use the name which will usually be easier to read when inspecting these statistics as we will see in the following tutorial\n"

    "### [ADVANCED] Most Important Functionality Provided by `World`\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is more of a reference. You need not go through it in details in your first read\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control several options about how your world simulation runs by setting constructor parameters of the `World` class (as we did earlier with `force_signing`). Here we discuss briefly some of the most important options. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### General \n",
    "These are general parameters that do not directly affect how the world works. The most important of these are `name` to set a name for the world, and `awi_type` which controls the type of AWI used to connect agents to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* name: World Name\n",
    "* bulletin_board: A bulletin board object to use. If not given one will be created\n",
    "* awi_type: The type used for agent world interfaces (must descend from or behave like `AgentWorldInterface` )\n",
    "* info: A dictionary of key-value pairs that is kept within the world but never used. It is useful for storing contextual information. For example, when running tournaments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulation parameters\n",
    "These options control how the simulation is run and the order of operations in each simulation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* n_steps: Total simulation time in steps\n",
    "* time_limit: Real-time limit on the simulation\n",
    "* operations: A list of `Operations` to run in order during every simulation step. You can use this parameter to set the order of events in your simulation. For example, you can choose when negotiations run relative to the `simulation_step` of your world.\n",
    "  Available operations include:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    * StatsUpdate: Updating statistics stored in `_stats` by calling `update_stats` of the `World` class. Each time this operation is conducted a higher `stage` is passed to the `update_stats` method (the first such call will by default run `pre_step_stats` and later calls will call `post_step_stats` but you can change that.\n",
    "    * SimulationStep: Calling `simulation_step` of the `World` class. Each time this operation is conducted a higher `stage` is passed to `simulation_step`.\n",
    "    * Negotiations: Running all registered negotiations\n",
    "    * ContractSigning: Sign contracts (if enabled)\n",
    "    * ContractExecution: Execute contracts\n",
    "    * AgentSteps: Step all agents by calling their `step` method\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Negotiation Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Controls all negotiations conducted during the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "* negotiation_speed: The number of negotiation steps per simulation step. None means infinite\n",
    "* neg_n_steps: Maximum number of steps allowed for a negotiation.\n",
    "* neg_step_time_limit: Time limit for single step of the negotiation protocol.\n",
    "* neg_time_limit: Real-time limit on each single negotiation\n",
    "* negotiation_quota_per_step: Number of negotiations an agent is allowed to start per step\n",
    "* negotiation_quota_per_simulation: Number of negotiations an agent is allowed to start in the simulation\n",
    "* start_negotiations_immediately: If true negotiations start immediately when registered rather than waiting for the next step\n",
    "* mechanisms: The mechanism types allowed in this world associated with each keyword arguments to be passed to it. This is a dictionary mapping a class name defining a mechanism to the parameters to use by default for that mechanism. For example, to allow both stacked alternating offers (with some custom setting) and the veto single text mechanisms in your world, you can use something like:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    super().__init__(mechanisms={\"negmas.sao.SAOMechanism\": dict(offering_is_accepting=False), \"negmas.st.STVetoMechanism\": dict()},\n",
    "                     ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Signing parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "After negotiations are concluded with agreements, it is possible to have an extra signing step to confirm these agreements before they become binding contracts. This gives agents central control over the agreements reached by their negotiators. You can control whether or not this step is needed for any world simulation and how confirmation (i.e. signing) is done through these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* default_signing_delay: The default number of steps between contract conclusion and signing it. Only takes effect if `force_signing` is `False`\n",
    "* force_signing: If true, agents are not asked to sign contracts. They are forced to do so. In this case, `default_singing_delay` is not effective and signature is immediate\n",
    "* batch_signing: If true, contracts are signed in batches not individually\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Breach Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "When contracts fail to execute, breaches occur. You can control what happens when breaches occur using this parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* breach_processing: How to handle breaches. Can be any of `BreachProcessing` values. Three options are available:\n",
    "    * No processing. In this case, the breach is just reported to the breach-list on the bulletin board and that is it.\n",
    "    * Victim, then perpetrator. In this case victims of the breach are given the chance to propose a resolution followed by the perpetrator.\n",
    "    * Renegotiation, where a complete negotiation session is conducted to resolve the breach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "NegMAS supports both general logs through the `log*` methods of the `World` class and agent specific logs through the `agent_log*` methods of the AWI. These parameters control logging. The default logging location is `~/negmas/logs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* log_folder: Folder to save all logs\n",
    "* log_to_file: If true, will log to a file\n",
    "* log_file_name: Name of the log file\n",
    "* log_file_level: The log-level to save to file (WARNING, ERROR, INFO, DEBUG, CRITICAL, ...)\n",
    "* log_ufuns: Log utility functions\n",
    "* log_negotiations: Log all negotiation events\n",
    "* log_to_screen: Whether to log to screen\n",
    "* log_screen_level: The log-level to show on screen (WARNING, ERROR, INFO, DEBUG, CRITICAL, ...)\n",
    "* no_logs: If True, All logging will be disabled no matter what other options are given.\n",
    "* log_stats_every: If nonzero and positive, the period of saving stats\n",
    "* construct_graphs: If true, information needed to draw graphs using `draw` method are kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What to save\n",
    "\n",
    "These settings greatly affect the memory consumption of the simulation. It tells NegMAS what exactly do you need to save in-memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* save_signed_contracts: Save all signed contracts\n",
    "* save_cancelled_contracts: Save all canceled contracts\n",
    "* save_negotiations: Save all negotiation records\n",
    "* save_resolved_breaches: Save all resolved breaches\n",
    "* save_unresolved_breaches: Save all unresolved breaches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exception Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "It is inevitable that exceptions will happen in agent code or the simulation. This set of parameters control how to handle these exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ignore_agent_exceptions: Ignore agent exceptions and keep running\n",
    "* ignore_mechanism_exceptions: If true, all mechanism exceptions are ignored and the mechanism is aborted\n",
    "* ignore_simulation_exceptions: Ignore simulation exceptions and keep running\n",
    "* ignore_contract_execution_exceptions: Ignore contract execution exceptions and keep running\n",
    "* safe_stats_monitoring: Never throw an exception for a failure to save stats or because of a Stats Monitor object\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checkpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "NegMAS can keep checkpoints of the world simulation that can be used to recover and continue the simulation later. These checkpoints are not stored by default but you can enable them and control their frequency and location using this set of parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "* checkpoint_every: The number of steps to checkpoint after. Set to <= 0 to disable\n",
    "* checkpoint_folder: The folder to save checkpoints into. Set to None to disable\n",
    "* checkpoint_filename: The base filename to use for checkpoints (multiple checkpoints will be prefixed with step number).\n",
    "* single_checkpoint: If true, only the most recent checkpoint will be saved.\n",
    "* extra_checkpoint_info: Any extra information to save with the checkpoint in the corresponding json file as\n",
    "                       a dictionary with string keys\n",
    "* exist_ok: IF true, checkpoints override existing checkpoints with the same filename.\n"
