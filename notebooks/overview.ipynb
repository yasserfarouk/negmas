				"\n",
				"The package is organized into a set of modules/packages that combine together related functionality. There are base modules, protocol specific modules, advanced and helper modules.\n",
				"\n",
				"* **Base Modules** Implements basic automated negotiation functionality:\n",
				"    1. **outcomes** This module represents issues, outcome and responses and provides basic functions and methods to operator with and on them.\n",
				"    1. **preferences** This modules represents the base type of all preferences and different widely used utility function types including linear and nonlinear utilities and constraint-based utilities. This module also implements basic analysis tools like finding the pareto-frontier, sampling outcomes with given utilities from the outcome space, etc.\n",
				"    1. **negotiators** This module represents basic negotiation agent implementation and provides basic interfaces to be overriden (implemented) by higher specialized modules\n",
				"    1. **mechanisms** This module represents the most basic conceptual view of a negotiation protocol supporting both mediate and unmediated mechanisms. The term `mechanism` was used  instead of the more common `protocol` to stress the fact that this mechanism need not be a standard negotiation protocol. For example auction mechanisms (like second-price auctions) can easily be implemented as a `Mechanism` in negmas.\n",
				"    1. **common** Provides data structures that are used by all modules including mechanism-state, and the agent-mechanism-interface.\n",
				"    1. **genius** Implements a specific type negotiator for the stacked alternating offers protocol called `GeniusNegotiator` which can run `NegotiationParty` based agents from the Java [Genius](http://ii.tudelft.nl/genius/) platform.\n",
				"\n",
				"* **Mechanism Specific Modules** These modules implement the base mechanism, negotiator type(s), state, and related computational resources specific to a single (or a set of related) negotiation/auction protocols\n",
				"    1. **sao** Implements that stacked alternating offers protocol for unmediated multiparty multi-issue negotiations. Other than providing the `SAOMechanism` class representing the protocol, this package provides a set of simple negotiators including the time-based `AspirationNegotiator`, a `SimpleTitForTatNegotiator`, among others.\n",
				"    1. **st** Implements two basic single-text mediated negotiation protocols (veto and hill-climbing) and the basic negotiator types to support them.\n",
				"    1. **mt** Implements and extension of single text mediated protocols to handle multiple *proposed agreements* in parallel.\n",
				"    1. **ga** Implements a Genetic Algorithm based single text mediated negotiation protocol\n",
				"   \n",
				"* **Advanced Negotiation Modules** These modules model advanced negotiation problems and techniques\n",
				"    1. **situated** Implements world simulations within which agents with intrinsic utility functions can engage in simultaneous interconnected situated negotiations. It is the most important module for the goals of this library. The `Agent` and `World` classes described in details later belong to this module\n",
				"    1. **modeling** This is a set of submodules implementing modeling of opponent utility, opponent strategy, opponent's future offers and opponent's probability of accepting offers.\n",
				"    1. **elicitation** Implements several preference elicitation during negotiation methods.\n",
				"    1. **concurrent** Implements mechanism types, and other computational resources to support concurrent negotiation.\n",
				"\n",
				"* **Helper Modules** These modules provide basic activities that is not directly related to the negotiation but that are relied upon by different base modules. The end user is not expected to interact directly with these modules.\n",
				"    * **common** Provides common interfaces that are used by all other modules. \n",
				"    * **helpers** Various helper functions and classes used throughout the library including mixins for logging.\n",
				"    * **inout** Provides functions to load and store XML Genius domains and utility functions.\n",
				"    * **java** \\[Depricated\\] Provides an interface to JNegMAS allowing agents and negotiators to be developed in Java.\n",
				"    * **tournaments** Supports creating and running tournaments to compare agents and negotiators.\n",
				"    * **checkpoints** Supports saving and reloading world simulations to/from secondary storage.\n",
				"    * **visualizers** \\[Under development\\] Supports visualization of world simulation, negotiation sessions, negotiators, and agents.\n",
				"    * **generics** Provides a set of types and interfaces to increase the representation flexibility of different base modules. \n",

				"[Agent](http://www.yasserm.com/negmas/api/negmas.situated.Agent.html)\n",
				"documentation for more details about general NegMAS agents. \n",
				"\n",
				"So now we have the **World** and the **Agent** objects, and we already said\n",
				"that the agent does not directly interact with the world. How does these two\n",
				"types of entities interact then?\n",
				"\n",
				"- When the **World** wants to interact with the **Agent**, it calls some method\n",
				"  in it. For example, to instruct the agent to *initialize* itself, the world\n",
				"  calls the **init()** method defined by the **Agent**. To inform the agent\n",
				"  that a negotiation it is involved in is concluded with success, the **World**\n",
				"  calls the method **on_negotiation_success()** defined by the agent.\n",

				"negotiation is managed in NegMAS. **Note that you can create negotiations that do\n",
				"not belong to any world**\n",
				"\n",
				"A negotiation is controlled by a **Mechanism** object which implements the\n",

				"[here](http://www.yasserm.com/negmas/api/negmas.common.NegotiatorMechanismInterface.html).\n",
				"\n",
				"Each specific **Mechanism** defines a corresponding specific\n",
				"**AgentMechanismInterface** class (in the same way that **World** classes\n",
				"define their own AWI). \n",
				"\n",
				"To negotiate effectively, negotiators employ a **UtilityFunction** \n",
				"(or any other form of **Preferences** objects) to represent\n",
				"their preferences over different possible **Outcome**s of the negotiation\n",
				"(where an outcome is a full assignment of values to all negotiated **Issue**s).\n",

				"controlled by the world while each negotiation is controlled by a mechanism\n",
				"within that world. **We need now to connect these two triplets of objects**\n",
				"\n",
				"As the figure above shows: **Negotiator** objects can be created and controlled\n",
				"by **Agent** objects for the purpose of negotiating with other **Agent**\n",
				"objects. The standard flow of operations is something like this:\n",
				"\n",
				"1. **Agent** A uses its AWI to *request_negotiation()* with Agent B passing a\n",
				"   **Negotiator** to be used in this negotiation. Usually Agent A will also\n",
				"   create a **UtilityFunction** and attach it to the **Negotiator** it just\n",
				"   created (by setting its *ufun* attribute).\n",
				"2. The **World** calls Agent B's *respond_to_negotiation_request()* asking it\n",
				"   to provide its own **Negotiator** to negotiate with Agent A's Negotiator. It\n",
				"   can also just reject the negotiation request by returning no negotiators.\n",
				"3. The **World** will then create a **Mechanism** and ask both **Negotiator**s\n",
				"   to *join* it.  If all goes well, the negotiation starts (at a time defined\n",
				"   by the simulation rules) and runs until either an agreement or disagreement\n",
				"   is reached.\n",
				"4. The **World** class will then inform **Agent**s A and B about the results of\n",
				"   the negotiation using their *on_negotiation_success* and\n",
				"   *on_negotiation_failure* callbacks. \n",
				"5. Successful negotiations lead to **Agreement**s but are still not binding in\n",
				"   general until signed by all agents involved (A and B in this case).\n",
				"   **Agent**'s '*sign_all_contracts* is used for this.\n",
				"6. Signed agreements become *Contract*s and are executed (as specified in the\n",
				"   simulation rules) by the **World**.\n",
				"\n",
				"When negotiations are independent, these are all the objects needed.\n",
				"Nevertheless, in many cases, negotiations are\n",
				"inter-dependent. This means that what is *good* in one negotiation depends on\n",
				"other concurrently running negotiations (or on expectations of future\n",
				"negotiations). NegMAS provides two ways to support this case shown in the\n",
				"following figure:\n",
				"\n",
				"![controllers](figs/controllers.jpg)\n",
				"\n",
				"1. Let **Negotiator**s use **UtilityFunction**s that depend on some common\n",
				"   state. That is what is happening in the left two negotiations. \n",
				"2. Have multiple **Negotiator**s be controlled by a single **Controller**\n",
				"   object with its own utility function that depends on what is happening on\n",
				"   all the negotiations controlled. \n",
				"\n",
				"The **Negotiator**s connected to a controller lost their autonomy and just pass \n",
				"control to their *owning* **Controller**. \n",
				"\n",
				"This concludes our introduction to NegMAS and different objects you need to know \n",
				"about to develop your agent."

Currently we use `scipy.stats` for modeling these distributions but this is an implementation detail that should not be relied upon as it is likely that the probabilistic framework will be changed in the future to enhance the flexibility of the package and its integration with other probabilistic modeling packages (e.g. PyMC3). A concrete implementation of `Distribution` provided by NegMAS is `ScipyDistribution`. A special case if the `Real` distribution which represents a delta distribution $\\delta(v)$ at a given real value $v$ (i.e. $p(x)=1$ for $x=v$ and $0$ otherwise) which acts both as a `Distribution` and a `float`. \n",

				"\n",
				"`Rational` entities in NegMAS (including `Agent`s, `Negotiator`s, and `Controller`s) can have `Preferences` which define how much they prefer an `Outcome` over another. Several types of preferences are supported in NegMAS and they all must implement the `BasePref` protocol.\n",
				"\n",
				"### Ordinal and Cardinal Preferences\n",
				"\n",
				"The most general `Preferences` type in NegMAS is `Ordinal` `Preferences` which can only represent partial ordering of outcomes in the outcome-space throgh the `is_not_worse()` method. An entity with this kind of preferences can compare two outcomes but it gets one bit of information out of this comparison (which is better for the entity) and has no way to know *how much* is the difference\n",
				"\n",
				"`CarindalProb` `Preferences`, on the other hand, implement `difference_prob()` which return a `Distribution` indicating *how much* is the difference between two outcomes. A crisp version (`CardinalCrisp`) moreover implements `difference()` which returns a `float` indicating *exactly* the difference in value for the entity between two outcomes.\n",
				"\n",
				"Every `CadrinalCrisp` object is a `CardinalProb` which is also an `Ordinal` object.\n",
				"\n",
				"### Crisp and Prob Preferences\n",
				"\n",
				"NegMAS usually implements two versions of each `Preferences` type (other than `Ordinal`) that represent a probabilistic version (ending with `Prob`) returing `Distribution`s when queried, and a crisp version (ending with `Crisp`) returning a `float`. This simplifies the development of agents and negotiators working with probability distributions.\n",
				"\n",
				"### Stationary and Non-Stationary Preferences\n",
				"\n",
				"Stationary `Preferences` are those that *do not change during the lifetime of their owner*, while non-stationary `Preferences`  are allowed to change. The entity having non-stationary preferences usually faces a harder problem achieving its goals as it needs to take into account this possible change. Entities interacting with other entities with non-stationary `Preferences` are also in reatively harder situation comapred with those dealing with entities with stationary `Preferences`. \n",
				"\n",
				"Stationary Preference type names start with `Stationary` (e.g. `StationaryCardinalProb`) while non-stationary types start with `NonStationary` (e.g. `NonStationaryCardinalProb`).\n",

				"Utility functions are entities that take an `Outcome` and return its `Value`. There are many types of utility functions defined in the literature. In this package, the base of all utiliy functions is the `BaseUtilityFunction` class which is defined in the `preferences.ufun` module. It behaves like a standard python `Callable` which can be called with a single `Outcome` object (i.e. a dictionary, list, tuple etc representing an outcome) and returns a `Value`. This allows utility functions to return a distribution instead of a single utility value. Special cases are `UtilityFunction` which is the base class of all crisp ufuns (returning a `float` when called) and `ProbUtilityFunction` which is the base class of all probabilistic ufuns (returning a `Distribution` when called).\n",
				"\n",
				"Utility functions in `negmas` have a helper `property` called `type` which returns the type of the utility function and a helper function `eu` for returning the expected utility of a given outcome which is guaranteed to return a real number (`float`) even if the utiliy function itself is returning a utility distribution.\n",

It may just end the negotiation with no agreement, may just remove the agent from the negotiation and keep it running with the remaining agents (if that makes sense) or just gives the agent a second chance by treating it as just a ``REJECT_OFFER`` case. In most case the first response (just end the negotiation) is expected.\n",

				"* `Controller` objects can access neither worlds nor mechanisms directly and they depend on agents to create them and on negotiators to negotiate for them.\n",
