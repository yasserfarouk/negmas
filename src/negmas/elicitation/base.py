            offer: the offer to respond to

        Remarks:
            - Does the following steps:

                1. Finds the the best offer using `best_offer` and uses the base negotiator
                   to respond if that offer was `None`
                2. Looks at `offerable_outcomes` and applies the elicitation strategy (one
                   step) to the outcome if it was not offerable (or if there are no offerable
                   outcomes defined).
                3. Finds the utility of the offer using `utility_function` not taking into accout
                   elicitation cost and uses the base negotiator if that fails (i.e. `utility_function`
                   returns `None`).
                4. Finds the expected utility of the offer using the `expect` () method which calls the
                   expector passed during construction.
                5. If the maximum attainable utility now (judging from the current estimation of
                   the utility value of each outcome taking elicitation cost into account) is less
                   than the reserved value, end the negotiation
                6. If the utility of my best offer (returned from `best_offer`) is less than the offered
                   utility, accept the offer
                7. Otherwise, call bhe base negotiator to respond.
