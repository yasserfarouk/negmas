    Represents an adapter agent that makes some included object act as an
    agent in some world.

    Args:

        obj: The object to be adapted.
        include_adapter_type_name: Whether to include the adapter type name. If
                                   None, then it will be included if it does
                                   not start with and underscore.
        include_obj_type_name: Whether to include object type name in this
                               adapter's type name
        type_postfix: A string to add to the end of the type name

    Remarks:

        - Other than keeping an internal copy of the adapted object under
          `obj`, this class is used primarily to provide a way to give
          good type_name and short_type_name properties that combine the name
          of the adapter and the name of the enclosed object nicely.
        - The adapted object must be an `Entity`.
        - The `World` class uses the type names from this adapter whenever
          it needs to get a type-name (either `type_name` or `short_type_name`)
