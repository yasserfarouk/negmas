History
=======

Release 0.11.3
--------------

* [feature] Adding completion_callback to runall()

Release 0.11.2
--------------

* Allow 0.11.* and 0.10.* signatures for the propose() method in SAONegotiator. You can now use any of the following signatures::

  - def propose(self, state)
  - def propose(self, state, dest)

Release 0.11.1
--------------

* added scenarios.load_scenario() to load negotiation scenarios distributed in negmas. Currently only CameraB is available.
* Documentation update

Release 0.11.0
--------------

* Freeing numpy version and passing data through
* minor: do not count None when counting types in issues
* minor: changing order of methods of controller
* Adding more negotiator accessors to controllers

  *  negotiators(self) -> dict[str, NegotiatorInfo]:
  *  unfinished_negotiators(self) -> dict[str, NegotiatorInfo]:
  *  finished_negotiators(self) -> dict[str, NegotiatorInfo]:
  *  to_start_negotiators(self) -> dict[str, NegotiatorInfo]:
  *  started_negotiators(self) -> dict[str, NegotiatorInfo]:
  *  active_negotiators(self) -> dict[str, NegotiatorInfo]:

* minor: better setting of time limits in run_session()
* Handling numpy arrays when dumping to yaml
* [bugfix] Passing python_class_identifier around
* When serializing/deserializing, not all classes were passing
* python_class_identifier which resulted in some of them always using
* [bugfix] __python_class__ which may lead to incorrect deserialization.
* Ensuring private_info is defined in mapneg
* Removing dependence on typing
* Passing extra_paths and extra_modules to deserialize and get_class
* Exporting calc_outcome_optimality from preferences.ops
* Avoid going too far when inverting a ufun
* Added passing numeric_prob to ufun generators. This allows us to generate ufun sets with outcome-spaces that are "sometimes" numeric.
* Allow passing kwargs to invert() in ufuns
* python_class_identifier in to_dict during serialization
* Using python-class-identifier everywhere
* This paramter to loading/saving functions allows the caller to change the identifier used to mark python classes in dumped files.
* Adding tau
* get_class returns None if given None
* Adding EnumeratingOutcomeSpace
* This outcome-space represents a set of outcomes with no issue structure.
* Supporting pydantic in serialization
* Compatibility with data-model-generator
* Adding intersection function to issues
* Renaming serial -> ordered in Mechanism.runall. This way it is less likely to be confused with sequential and it better represents what is happening.
* Adding ordering_fun for dynamic ordering runall
* Typing corrections
* More genius tests
* Passing a couple of tests of ufun inversion
* Github Action Updates
* Fixing testing is some Actions
* Casting conflict_level output to float
* Switching to uv

* Removing SAOCall and SAOPR from ALL_NEGOTIATORS
* Checking that all indices appear in the ordering
* Adding sequential option to Mechanism.runall()

  * You can run negotiations sequentially in runall
  * You can specify the ordering in serial runs explicitly

* Ufuns can have an invalid-value
* If the offer is not in the outcome-space and the invalid-value is not None, the invalid-value will be returned form __call__ in all ufuns formatting update
* Adding default negotiator type to all controllers
* bugfix: Adding context in controllers
* Extra copying of ufuns and private infos to avoid sharing a copy of the ufun or any private info between the negotiator and the scenario or the negotiators which can cause hard-to-find bugs
* Adding support for ANL-Agents in negotiate CLI. You can now use anl.anl2024.MissG for example as a negotiator. This will use the anl-agents package if it is installed. You can also pass --share-ufuns and --share-reserved-values to pass opponent ufuns (as in ANL 2024) to negotiators This makes it possible to run a negotiation like this:

  ```bash
  negotiate --plot -p sao -n anl.anl2024.Shochan -n anl.anl2024.AgentRenting2024 --steps=180 --share-ufuns --no-share-reserved-values
  ````

* Adding estimated_time_limit/n_steps to NMI
* Documenting private info
* Adding atomic_steps to all NMIs
* Adding history to all states. Moreover, we added extended_trace and trace to SAOP states
* Doc update: Improving upgrade guide
* feature: Adding ExtendedOutcome containing data
* Now SAO and GP negotiators can return an extended outcome from their proposal strategy which consists of an outcome and a dict with extra data. Examples include text, images, videos, arguments, etc. This is now supported for all SAOMechanism and GBMechanism(s).
* Generating ufuns with variable n_values
* Improving accuracy of inv-ufun
* Requiring final scores when complete_only
* Adding complete_only in Cartesian tournament combination
* Better loading-saving of cartesian tournaments

* Stop testing notebooks on 3.10
* Checking for NMI when filtering in controllers
* Adding timeout to all github actions
* Filtering unexpected offers before counter_all
* Adding is_clean() to controllers
* Checks that a controller has no negotiators and not internal state (i.e. it is in a blank state)
* Saving negotiation details in World
* Default to no neg-step-time-limit in World
* just-in-time filtering of ended negs to controllers
* Agent IDs and names in NMI match negotiator order
* Adding completed/done to MechanismState (= ended)
* [buffix] new_offers and dominant_outcomes init
* These were incorrectly intialized to a type list instead of an empty list.
* Adding Kalai-Smorodinsky to stats
* The current implementation is approximate
* Mechanism params saved in scenarios in tournaments
* Minor printing improvement in tournaments

Release 0.10.23
---------------

* Tournament combination in Cartesian tournaments

    * Cartesian tournaments were structured to allow for saving and loading
    * Added load/save/combine to SimpleTournamentResults
    * Added combine_tournament for combining on disk tournament results with control on copying and scenario renaming

* Adding max-tasks-per-child to all tournaments
* Supporting world-timeout in tournaments
* Do not end tournaments if a single future timesout

Release 0.10.22
---------------

* Saving repeated runs in cartesian tournaments.
* Adding sort_runs to cartesian tournaments. Passing sort_runs overrides randomize_runs and causes smaller scenarios to be negotiated first. Scenario's size is the product of the outcome-space cardinality, number of steps, and time-limits.
* Improving parallelism in cartesian tournaments:

  * Adding max-tasks-per-process
  * Adding external_timeout to cartesian tournaments. This parameter is only effective for parallel runs and enforces and external timeout on all tasks. This will avoid waiting for slow negotiators but it has the disadvantage of causing the main thread to never end. Tournaments may now need C-c to end.
* Adding _InfiniteWaiter negotiator for testing
* Accepting None for hidden_time_limit in Mechanism.

Release 0.10.21
---------------

* More exception resistance in cartesian_tournament
* Base Mechanism class now can ignore exceptions in initialization of agents
* More consistent naming of methods involving negotiators

Release 0.10.20
---------------

* Matching the behavior of Genius in relative_time.
  Originally, NegMAS used the following rule for relative_time R:

  i = 0 => R = 0

  i > 0 => R = min(1, max(t/T, (i+1)/(N+1)))

  where i is the current step, t is current time, T is time_limit, N is
  n_steps.

  After this change the special case at i=0 is removed:

  R = min(1, max(t/T, (i+1)/(N+1)))

  This matches Genius behavior exactly if we have either T=\infty or
  N=\infty.
* More info in printing in cartesian verbose
* Rounding output in cartesian verbose mode
* Printing execution time in cartesian verbose

Release 0.10.19
---------------

* Saving erred-negotiator and erred-agent in MechanismState in case of errors in SAO  and related mechanisms
* Saving details about errors (including traceback) in cartesian products (in all_scores.csv).

Release 0.10.18
---------------

* Improving the way some stats are saved in situated
* CLI improvements

  Now the "negotiate" CLI has a much better help. Try:

  >> negotiate --help

  Moreover, we added the ability to generate scenarios and save them as
  well as more control over statistics

Release 0.10.17
---------------

* correcting the way some stats are saved. Avoids both double saving of stats in some cases and not saving them at all in others

Release 0.10.16
---------------

* Avoid controller failure if a wrong ID is passed

Release 0.10.15
---------------

* Making controllers generics for typing stability
* Adding agent_names back to the NMI

Release 0.10.14
---------------
* Running bridge in slow actions
* Adding a tutorial about using the genius bridge
* Getting "negmas genius" to work as expected and adding more arguments to it

* Fixing logo path

Release 0.10.13
---------------
* Minor coloring in tournaments
* Adding plot_stats() and stat_names to World
* Always using sync-calls when debugging
* Testing hidden time limit
* Better ufun generation. negmas.preferences.generators now have two functions:
    generate_single_issue_ufuns and generate_multi_issue_ufuns. These can be
    used to generate ufuns using any generator in the GENERATOR_MAP with
    full control:
    - can control issue, outcome and ufun names
    - can control reserved values and/or rational fractions
    - can control the type: numeric/string issues and linear-additive/mapping ufuns
* MappingUFun returns -inf for non-existing outcomes
* Now mapping ufuns will return 0.0 for unknown values not None
* bugfix: fixing activity level and other stat calculation
* Adding generate_multi_issue_ufuns. This generator generates a set of ufuns for a multi-issue scenario with
    controllable pareto generators
* Adding plotting to Scenario
* doc: removing svg explicit setting

Release 0.10.12
---------------
* Adding GB to the mechanisms docs
* Saving scenario figs by default in Cartesian tournaments
* Showing inheritance graphs in docs

Release 0.10.11
---------------
* Adding TimeBasedOfferingStrategy
* bugfix: Incorrect scenario names sometimes. Caused by updating the same scenario object in multiple consecutive runs specially when running serial tournaments.
* feature: Negotiator logs in mechanisms

    - Negotiators can use self.nmi.log_info to log information in the
      mechanism that is accessible for any one who can access the mechanism.
      log_warning, log_error, log_debug, log_critical are also available.
    - Logs are stored as structured dicts that will be converted to data
      frames. IT IS NECESSARY for all logs with the same key to have the
      same EXACT keys and it is recommended for their values to have the
      same type.
    - Cartesian tournaments will now save these logs after the mechanism
      ends if any are given and logging is enabled (i.e. path is passed to
      cartesian_tournament()).

    Limitations:

       - You MUST pass a key (nid) to all log functions. If two different
         negotiators passed the same key, these logs will be combined in a
         single file. This may be too cooperative and confusing!!
       - The logs are not returned in SimpleTournamentResults. If you need
         to read the logs you must save logs to the HDD. This is by design
         because these logs may be too large and keeping them to return them
         after the tournament may consume too much memory. Currently, they
         will be deleted from memory with the mechanism.

-------------

This is a major release and it is **not** backward compatible. Please reference
the upgrade guide at the upgrdade guide_.

.. _guide: https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrade_guide.html

Some of the most important changes are:

* Introduces the `ModularNegotiator` and `Component` objects to simplify reuse of negotiation strategies through composition instead of inheritance.
* Restructures most of the code-base for readability.
* Completed the tutorial.
* Simplified several key methods.
* Introduced the `SAOModularNegotiator`, `MAPNegotiator`, `BOANegotiator` as basic modular negotiators for the SAO mechanism as well as reusable components like `AcceptanceStrategy`, and `OfferingStrategy`

  GeniusNegotiator (or in an n_steps limited negotaition with strict not given
  at all), more tests are incorporated to make sure that the Genius agent is
  getting what it expects all the time.
* [sao] relative_time matches Genius behavior.  relative_time was equal to
  step/n_steps now it is (step+1)/(n_steps+1) This is only in the case of using
  n_steps as a limit of a mechanism.

* [genius] Added is_installed to GeniusBridge and genius_bridge_is_installed()
* [bugfix] Handling wrong time perception in Genius agents

    * A warning is now raised in either of the following cases:
        1. A mechanism is created with neither a time_limit nor n_step set
        2. A Genius agent tries to join a mechanism with both time_limit and
           n_steps set
    * We stopped using timeline.increment() inside the genius bridge and now
      pass the round number (step in negmas terms) directly from negmas.
      This should avoid any possibility of double counting
* [sao] Adding enforce_outcome_type to SAOMechanism

- Installing jenegmas 0.2.6 by default in negmas jengmas-setup command

Release 0.2.12
--------------

- updating run scml tutorial
- tox setting update to avoid a break in latest pip (19.1.0)
- handling an edge case with both partners committing breaches at the same
  time.
- testing reduced max-insurance setting
- resolving a bug in contract resolution when the same agent commits
  multiple money breaches on multiple contracts simultaneously.
- better assertion of correct contract execution
- resolving a bug in production that caused double counting of some
  production outputs when multiple lines are executed generating the
  same product type at the same step.
- ensuring that the storage reported through awi.state or
  simulator.storage_* are correct for the current step. That involves
  a slight change in an undocumented feature of production. In the past
  produced products were moved to the factory storage BEFORE the
  beginning of production on the next step. Now it is moved AFTER the
  END of production of the current step (the step production was
  completed). This ensures that when the factory manager reads its
  storage it reflects what it actually have at all times.
- improving printing of RunningCommandInfo and ProductionReport
- regenerating setup.py
- revealing jobs in FactoryState
- handling a bug that caused factories to have a single line sometimes.

- updating insurance premium percents.
- adding more tests of NaiveTitForTatNegotiator
- removing relative_premium/premium confusion. Now evaluate_premium will
  always return a premium as a fraction of the contract total cost not
  as the full price of the insurance policy. For a contract of value 30,
  a premium of 0.1 means 3 money units not 0.1 money units.
- adding --config option to tournament and scml commands of negmas CLI
  to allow users to set default parameters in a file or using
  environment variables
- unifying the meaning of negative numbers for max_insurance_premium to
  mean never buying insuance in the scheduler, manager, and app. Now you
  have to set max_insurance_premium to inf to make the system
- enforcing argument types in negmas CLI
- Adding DEFAULT_NEGOTIATOR constant to apps.scml.common to control the
  default negotiator type used by built-agents
- making utility_function a property instead of a data member of
  negotiator
- adding on_ufun_changed() callback to Negotiator instead of relying on
  on_nofitication() [relying on on_notification still works].
- deprecating passing dynamic_ufun to constructors of all negotiators
- removing special treatment of AspirationNegotiator in miners
- modifications to the implementation of TitForTatNegotiator to make it
  more sane.
- deprecating changing the utility function directly (using
  negotiator.ufun = x) AFTER the negotiation starts. It is
  still possible to change it up to the call to join()
- adding negmas.apps.scml.DEFAULT_NEGOTIATOR to control the default negotiator used
- improved parameter settings (for internal parameters not published in the SCML document)
- speeding up ufun dumping
- formatting update
- adding ufun logging as follows:

  * World and SCMLWorld has now log_ufuns_file which if not None gives a file to log the funs into.
  * negmas tournament and scml commands receive a --log-ufuns or --no-log-ufuns to control whether
    or not to log the ufuns into the tournament/world stats directory under the name ufuns.csv

- adding a helper add_records to add records into existing csv files.


Release 0.2.11
--------------
- minor bug fix

Release 0.2.10
--------------

- adding more control to negmas tournaments:

   1. adding --factories argument to control how many factories (at least) should exist on each production
      level
   2. adding --agents argument to control how many agents per competitor to instantiate. For the anac2019std
      ttype, this will be forced to 1

- adding sabotage track and anac2019_sabotage to run it
- updating test assertions for negotiators.
- tutorial update
- completed NaiveTitForTatNegotiator implementation


Release 0.2.9
-------------

- resolving a bug in AspirationNegotiator that caused an exception for ufuns with assume_normalized
- resolving a bug in ASOMechanism that caused agreements only on boundary offers.
- using jnegmas-0.2.4 instead of jnegmas-0.2.3 in negmas jnegmas-setup command


Release 0.2.8
-------------

- adding commands to FactoryState.
- Allowing JNegMAS to use GreedyFactoryManager. To do that, the Java factory manager must inherit from
  GreedyFactoryManager and its class name must end with either GreedyFactoryManager or GFM


Release 0.2.7
-------------

- improving naming of java factory managers in log files.
- guaranteeing serial tournaments when java factory managers are involved (to be lifter later).
- adding links to the YouTube playlist in README
- adhering to Black style


Release 0.2.6
-------------

- documentation update
- setting default world runs to 100 steps
- rounding catalog prices and historical costs to money resolution
- better defaults for negmas tournaments
- adding warnings when running too many simulations.
- added version command to negmas
- corrected the way min_factories_per_level is handled during tournament config creation.
- added --factories to negmas tournament command to control the minimum number of factories per level.
- improving naming of managers and factories for debugging purposes
- forcing reveal-names when giving debug option to any negmas command
- adding short_type_name to all Entity objects for convenient printing

Release 0.2.5
-------------

- improvements to ufun representation to speedup computation
- making default factory managers slightly less risky in their behavior in long simulations and more risky
  in short ones
- adding jnegmas-setup and genius-setup commands to download and install jenegmas and genius bridge
- removing the logger mixin and replaced it with parameters to World and SCMLWorld
- added compact parameter to SCMLWorld, tournament, and world generators to reduce the memory footprint
- added --compact/--debug to the command line tools to avoid memory and log explosion setting the default to
  --compact
- improving implementation of consumer ufun for cases with negative schedule
- changing the return type of SCMLAWI.state from Factory to FactoryState to avoid modifying the original
  factory. For efficiency reasons, the profiles list is passed as it is and it is possible to modify it
  but that is forbidden by the rules of the game.
- Speeding up and correcting financial report reception.
- Making bankruptcy reporting system-wide
- avoiding execution of contracts with negative or no quantity and logging ones with zero unit price.
- documentation update
- bug fix to resolve an issue with ufun calculation for consumers in case of over consumption.
- make the default behavior of negmas command to reveal agent types in their names
- preventing agents from publishing CFPs with the ID of other agents
- documentation update
- improved Java support
- added option default_dump_extension to ~/negmas/config.json to enable changing the format of dumps from json to yaml.
  Currently json is the default. This included adding a helper function helpers.dump() to dump in the selected format
  (or overriding it by providing a file extension).
- completing compatibility with SCML description (minor change to the consumer profile)
- added two new options to negmas tournament command: anac2019std and anac2019collusion to simulate these two tracks of
  the ANAC 2019 SCML. Sabotage version will be added later.
- added two new functions in apps.scml.utils anac2019_std, anac2019_collusion to simulate these two tracks of the ANAC
  2019 SCML. Sabotage version will be added later.
- added assign_managers() method to SCMLWorld to allow post-init assignment of managers to factories.
- updating simulator documentation
